Basic read me
The motivation to create a portfolio was to showcase my work to potential employers.
as stated in in the first point, this is to showcase my work to a potential employer.
This puts my work out there an easily assessable, shows basic knowledge and work that i have gon through.
I learned to build for mobile first and build out, being that most people view websites via moble devices, flex boxes too did have a problem with my nav bar not going under my H1.
Nothing just yet i only have a basic grasp but once I further my education this page will be edited and updated to show what I have been taught/ what more i can do.
